// The following code is a modified copy of: https://github.com/didiercrunch/paillier/blob/753322e473bf8ee20267c7824e68ae47360cc69b/safe_prime_generator.go
// It is an implementation of the algorithm described in "Safe Prime Generation with a Combined Sieve" https://eprint.iacr.org/2003/186.pdf

// The code is the original Go implementation of rand.Prime optimized for
// generating safe (Sophie Germain) primes.
// A safe prime is a prime number of the form 2p + 1, where p is also a prime.

// Note from Author (https://github.com/pdyraga):
// I've adapted a Go code for generating random numbers by inserting some
// optimisations that will allow us to generate safe primes faster than
// with the previous, naive approach.
//
// First of all, having q which can be prime, we first check whether q%3=1.
// If that's true, there is no chance p=2q+1 is prime. It lets us to reject
// candidate numbers quicker without running an expensive primality tests.
//
// Also, before we run a primality test for q, we may check p=2q+1 against
// the primes between 3-53 (We are limited by Go's uint64 range).
//
// If all those conditions are met and we know p is prime, it's enough to
// check Pocklington criterion for q instead of running an expensive
// primality test for it.

// smallPrimes is a list of small, prime numbers that allows us to rapidly
// exclude some fraction of composite candidates when searching for a random
// prime. This list is truncated at the point where smallPrimesProduct exceeds
// a uint64. It does not include two because we ensure that the candidates are
// odd by construction.
var smallPrimes = []uint8{
	3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53,
}

// smallPrimesProduct is the product of the values in smallPrimes and allows us
// to reduce a candidate prime by this number and then determine whether it's
// coprime to all the elements of smallPrimes without further big.Int
// operations.
var smallPrimesProduct = new(big.Int).SetUint64(16294579238595022365)

// ErrGeneratorCancelled is an error returned from GetRandomSafePrimesConcurrent
// when the work of the generator has been cancelled as a result of the context
// being done (cancellation or timeout).
var ErrGeneratorCancelled = fmt.Errorf("generator work cancelled")

// GetRandomSafePrimesConcurrent tries to find safe primes concurrently.
// The returned results are safe primes `p` and prime `q` such that `p=2q+1`.
// Concurrency level can be controlled with the `concurrencyLevel` parameter.
// If a safe prime could not be found before the context is done, the error
// is returned. Also, if at least one search process failed, error is returned
// as well.
//
// How fast we generate a prime number is mostly a matter of luck and it depends
// on how lucky we are with drawing the first bytes.
// With today's multi-core processors, we can execute the process on multiple
// cores concurrently, accept the first valid result and cancel the rest of
// work. This way, with the same finding algorithm, we can get the result
// faster.
//
// Concurrency level should be set depending on what `bitLen` of prime is
// expected. For example, as of today, on a typical workstation, for 512-bit
// safe prime, `concurrencyLevel` should be set to `1` as generating the prime
// of this length is a matter of milliseconds for a single core.
// For 1024-bit safe prime, `concurrencyLevel` should be usually set to at least
// `2` and for 2048-bit safe prime, `concurrencyLevel` must be set to at least
// `4` to get the result in a reasonable time.
//
// This function generates safe primes of at least 6 `bitLen`. For every
// generated safe prime, the two most significant bits are always set to `1`
// - we don't want the generated number to be too small.

// Starts a Goroutine searching for a safe prime of the specified `pBitLen`.
// If succeeds, writes prime `p` and prime `q` such that `p = 2q+1` to the
// `primeCh`. Prime `p` has a bit length equal to `pBitLen` and prime `q` has
// a bit length equal to `pBitLen-1`.
//
// The algorithm is as follows:
//  1. Generate a random odd number `q` of length `pBitLen-1` with two the most
//     significant bits set to `1`.
//  2. Execute preliminary primality test on `q` checking whether it is coprime
//     to all the elements of `smallPrimes`. It allows to eliminate trivial
//     cases quickly, when `q` is obviously no prime, without running an
//     expensive final primality tests.
//     If `q` is coprime to all of the `smallPrimes`, then go to the point 3.
//     If not, add `2` and try again. Do it at most 10 times.
//  3. Check the potentially prime `q`, whether `q = 1 (mod 3)`. This will
//     happen for 50% of cases.
//     If it is, then `p = 2q+1` will be a multiple of 3, so it will be obviously
//     not a prime number. In this case, add `2` and try again. Do it at most 10
//     times. If `q != 1 (mod 3)`, go to the point 4.
//  4. Now we know `q` is potentially prime and `p = 2q+1` is not a multiple of
//  3. We execute a preliminary primality test on `p`, checking whether
//     it is coprime to all the elements of `smallPrimes` just like we did for
//     `q` in point 2. If `p` is not coprime to at least one element of the
//     `smallPrimes`, then go back to point 1.
//     If `p` is coprime to all the elements of `smallPrimes`, go to point 5.
//  5. At this point, we know `q` is potentially prime, and `p=q+1` is also
//     potentially prime. We need to execute a final primality test for `q`.
//     We apply Miller-Rabin and Baillie-PSW tests. If they succeed, it means
//     that `q` is prime with a very high probability. Knowing `q` is prime,
//     we use Pocklington's criterion to prove the primality of `p=2q+1`, that
//     is, we execute Fermat primality test to base 2 checking whether
//     `2^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)`. It's significantly faster than running full
//     Miller-Rabin and Baillie-PSW for `p`.
//     If `q` and `p` are found to be prime, return them as a result. If not, go
//     back to the point 1.
